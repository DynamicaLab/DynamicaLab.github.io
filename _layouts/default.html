		  <p>
        We are a research group dedicated to the understanding of the structure and of the dynamics of complex systems using tools from statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, differential geometry, statistical inference, and deep learning.
        <br><br>
        Some of the current research topics include:
        <ul>
          <li>Learning dynamical processes on complex networks from time series</li>
          <li>Immersion of complex networks in hyperbolic spaces</li>
          <li>Dimension reduction of dynamics on large networks</li>
          <li>Detection of critical species from co-occurrence patterns in ecological data</li>
          <li>Modelization of self-organized plasma formation in solids</li>
          <li>Resilience of neural networks</li>
          <li>Synchronization in networks of oscillators</li>
          <li>Localization of spreading processes on networks</li>
          <li>Inference of connectomes from neural activity data</li>
          <li>Percolation on complex networks</li>
          <li>Community and hierarchical structures of networks</li>
        </ul>
