Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Sergey Melnik will be visiting snowy Quebec City between the 17th and 22nd of November.


 While his recent research focus mostly on spreading process on networks, he also has a keen interest for the dynamics of semiconductor laser, a subject that is close to the interest of our photonics section.


 During his stay, Dr. Melnik will be giving a talk entitled "Modeling the structure and dynamics of complex networks".
