The latest contributions of the Networks division (n=2) are now available on arxiv.org.


 The first paper, entitled "Finite size analysis of the detectability limit of the stochastic block model", focuses on the detectability limit in finite networks. We approach the problem from an algorithm-independent point of view,
i.e., we focus on the information theoretic causes of the detectability problem. This point of view allows us to establish, among other things, i.
classes of networks with block partitions equally hard to detect, ii. a condition for detectability, and iii. a quantitative relation between the level of corruption in the dataset (missing or spurious edges) and the difficulty of the detection problem.


 In the second contribution, entitled "Susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on the rewired configuration model", we investigate the SIS dynamics on networks drawn from the configuration model, whose edges are constantly being rewired (whilst preserving the degree). This rewiring network approach
(RNA!) leads to an explicit connection between many formalism that focus on the so-called annealed and quasi-static limits of the dynamics. Furthermore,
it provides a natural interpolation for the intermediate regimes (rewiring rate similar to the recovery rate).
