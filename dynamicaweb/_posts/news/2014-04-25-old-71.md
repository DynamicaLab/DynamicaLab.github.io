April 24th saw the second edition of our now traditional Symposium Numerica, a pedagogical activity held as part of the Numerical Physics course. Near the end of the semester, students are given a project and are tasked with making the most out of their nascent numerical skills. During the Symposium, each team must present their work to a jury composed of their peers and of the members of the research group. The program of the day is available here.


 This year, we had the honour to have Daniel Côté and Philippe Després as our distinguished guests.
