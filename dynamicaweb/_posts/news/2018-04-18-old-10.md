Béatrice Désy (BD), an undergraduate student in Physics at Laval University,
will join the Network division this summer. Part of her venture will be the study of co-occurrence patterns in complex ecological networks, in the spirit of the Sentinel North Strategy. It will also be a good opportunity for her to learn and explore the many facets of Network Science, anchored in statistical physics and graph theory.


 Welcome aboard!
