It seems that three is the magic number : a third contribution from the Networks section has been published in the latest issue of Physical Review E.


 The paper entitled "Geometric evolution of complex networks with degree correlations" presents a novel model for network growth. The structure evolves in a metric space, and new nodes create links with existing ones with a probability that is a function of both, time and distance between the nodes.
This growth model allows to reproduce many features of real world networks,
such as the clustering (triadic closure) and the degree-degree correlations.
