It is always a pleasure to acknowledge the undeniable success of one of the members of Dynamica. Edward Laurence has completed the requirements for his M.Sc. degree. His master thesis with the flamboyant title of “Study of Complex Systems – from networks to the brain connectome” can be read here.
Congratulations are in order, and we are happy to inform that Edward (Edgar for the intimate few) has chosen (wisely !) to remain within the fold for his Ph. D. research.
