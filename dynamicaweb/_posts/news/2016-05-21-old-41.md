Jean-Luc Déziel will present his latest work on self-organized plasma formation at Photonics North 2016, in Québec, Canada.


 In his talk, Jean-Luc will show how to incorporate extreme non-linear optics into particle in cell simulations of the interaction between light and matter.
He will argue that the resulting numerical framework is ideal to study self-
organized plasma formation.


 As always, head over to the publication page to read the abstract.
