The latest contribution of the Photonics section, entitled _Ab initio investigation of lasing thresholds in photonic molecules_ , will be published in the August issue of J. Opt. Soc. Am B. In it, Denis Gagnon studies the lasing thresholds of photonic molecules by using the recently developed steady-state _ab initio_ laser theory (SALT). The full text is available on the Publications page.
