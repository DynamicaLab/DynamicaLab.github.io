_Physical Review E_ has recently announced that they will be marking a small numbers of articles with a seal reserved for papers 'of particular interest,
importance, or clarity.'


 On that note, we wish to announce that _Coexistence of phases and the observability of random graphs_ has been published in PRE and has been chosen as an Editors' Suggestion. We congratulate Antoine Allard (and his co-authors)
for this fine work and hope this paper will receive the attention it deserves.
