Laurent Hébert-Dufresne (LSD) is one of the 10 recipients of this year 2013
JSMF Fellowships. The post-doctoral award comes with a small (!) stipend at the level of $200 000 US for 2 years. We congratulate LSD for this remarkable achievement and are proud to salute the collaborative spirit and work of the Network section of Dynamica that helped make the application for the Fellowship a outstanding success. The title of the research to be pursued under the Fellowships reads:« Co-evolution dynamics : from disease spread and resource distribution in human systems to biological and cultural evolution ».
Is there more to say?
