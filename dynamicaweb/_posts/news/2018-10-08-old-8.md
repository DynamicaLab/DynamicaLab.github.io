After careful examination, the evaluation committee has given the highest overall mark (excellent) to the Doctoral thesis of Jean-Gabriel Young.
Therefore, the name of the author will be added to the Board of Honour of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It perpetuates the group's tradition of excellence, with 9 theses added to the Board of Honour in 10 years.


 Congratulations are not only a good idea, but another occasion (as if we needed an excuse) for celebration.
