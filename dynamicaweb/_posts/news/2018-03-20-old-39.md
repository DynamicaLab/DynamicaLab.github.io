Guillaume ST-ONGE has been selected to attend the 2018 edition of the Complex Systems Summer School organized by the Santa Fe Institute. The summer school will be held in Santa Fe, NM from June 10 to July 6. Congratulations are in order. Here is an excerpt from the letter of acceptance highlighting the importance of the honour bestowed upon another member of the group (after Antoine Allard in 2011, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne in 2012, and Jean-Gabriel Young in 2015) :



“… The seminar is a scientific and educational program that provides a unique opportunity for graduate students, early career scientists, and professionals to further develop a solid foundation in interdisciplinary complex systems science. You have been invited because of your unusually strong application .”
