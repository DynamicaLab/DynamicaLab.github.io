The 15th of June 2017, Pr. Louis J. Dubé has presented the thematic project 1
to the Sentinel North's community, followed by the detailed description of the
5 subprojects by each investigator in charge. 

 Due to the transdisciplinary aim of Sentinel North, scientists in many fields,
from biology to architecture, had the pleasure to learn that on average, your friends have more friends than you.
