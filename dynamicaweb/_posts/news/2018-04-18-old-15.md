It is always a pleasure to acknowledge the continuing success of one of the members of Dynamica. Charles Murphy has completed the requirements for his M.Sc. degree. His master thesis, with the unmistakable title of “De la structure croissante des réseaux complexes: approche de la géométrie des réseaux” (On the growth of complex networks: a geometric networks approach),
can be read on the thesis page. The core of his works, the paper entitled
"Geometric evolution of complex networks with degree correlations", is also available on the journal page.


 Congratulations are in order, and we are happy to inform that Charles
(Morpheus) has chosen (wisely !) to remain within the fold for his Ph. D.
research, under the guidance of his advisors : Pr. Louis J. Dubé and Pr.
Antoine Allard.
