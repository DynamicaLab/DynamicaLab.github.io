It is with great pride that we announce that Guillaume Painchaud-April has successfully defended his thesis entitled " **Dielectric cavities: Scattering formalism and applications** " and has therefore been awarded the title of Philosophiae Doctor (Ph. D.). The event took place on the 11th of December
2013 as mentioned in previous news.


 The final version of his thesis is now available from the theses page.


 During his time in the group, Dr. Painchaud-April has been the rock upon which we all, at one time or another, reached for support. He has developed into a thorough and careful analyst unafraid to tackle the most daunting difficulties. His thesis is a testimony of his skill and his thoughtful insights. We wish him well for his future endeavours.


 Dr. Painchaud-April is continuing his career as a NDT Specialist in the Solutions and Technologies Group of Olympus NDT Canada (www.olympus-IMS.com).
