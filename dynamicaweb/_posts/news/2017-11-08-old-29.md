This fall, the Network division has been particularly active abroad. As a reminder, Edward Laurence attended the 4th Mediterranean School of Complex Networks this September in Salina. Also, this October, Jean-Gabriel Young was in Bloomington (Indiana) at the Sporn's lab to work with collaborators.


 Recently, Guillaume St-Onge visited and gave a talk at the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) in Seattle (Washington). He was invited by a former member of Dynamica, Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne. Also, Charles Murphy is currently at the Macfang workshop in Barcelona (Catalonia), whose focus is on the role of space and geometry in complex networks. He will give a lightning talk,
followed by a poster session.


 May the contributions from Dynamica continue to spread and impress abroad!
More details about the talks are available on the conference page.
