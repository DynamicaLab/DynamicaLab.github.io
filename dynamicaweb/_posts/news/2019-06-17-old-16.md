The latest contribution of the network section is available in the July issue of Computer Physics Communication.


 The paper entitled [Efficient sampling of spreading processes on complex networks using a composition and rejection algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.02.008) propose an efficient simulation scheme for simple contagion models on networks, represented by a discrete-state and continuous time Markov process. The method hinges on a clever composition and rejection step that allows the efficient sampling of heterogeneous (and time-varying) probability distributions.
