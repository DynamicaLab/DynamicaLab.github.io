Social networks encode the interactions of the elements of a social system;
one thinks, for instance, of Facebook, where individuals interact through friendship relations. A striking feature of most social networks is their modularity, a feature implying that individuals are not connected at random but rather that connections are the reflection of social communities.
Structurally, small communities---such as group of friends or nuclear families
---are usually tightly connected groups, whereas larger communities---such as workplaces or schools---are loosely connected group of individuals.


 In our latest paper, titled " _Growing networks of overlapping communities with internal structure_ ", we argue that this difference of connection density is the result of the continuous growth of social networks. We support this proposition with empirical evidence, and present a general recipe to realistically model real social networks. Our approach offers a natural and dynamical explanation of the Dunbar number, i.e., an upper bound on the number of connection that individuals can sustain in a social network.
