Jean-Luc DÃ©ziel attended the International Conference on Laser Ablation (COLA)
2017, September 3-8 in Marseille. He presented a poster entitled "Femtosecond Self-Reconfiguration of Periodic Plasma Patterns in Dielectrics", available on the conference page. Despite being absent for the mandatory 100 km bicycle ride in Quebec, he did his part in a trail with even more magnificent landscapes.
