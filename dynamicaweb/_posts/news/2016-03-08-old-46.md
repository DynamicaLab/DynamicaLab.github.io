We are happy to announce that the latest contribution of the networks division, entitled " _Constrained growth of complex scale-independent systems_
", is now featured in the highlights of Physical Review E for its 'particular interest, importance, [and] clarity'.


 One of the perks that comes with the recognition is a crystal clear summary of our work. which reads as follows


  _Scale-free distributions of resources arise in very diverse systems, such as in the distribution of wealth or of the population of cities. By coupling the overall population growth with the individual growth in resources, the authors propose a model describing the emergence of such behavior. Through this model,
the authors introduce a method to reconstruct the past or forecast the future from a snapshot of data._
