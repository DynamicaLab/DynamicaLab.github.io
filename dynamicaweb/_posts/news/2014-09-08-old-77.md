It is with pride that we announce that Joey Dumont and Jean-Gabriel Young have submitted for evaluation their master’s theses entitled "On the Modelization of Optical Devices: From Dielectric Cavities to Radiating Structures" and « De la Détection de la Structure Communautaire des Réseaux Complexes » (On the Detection of Community Structure in complex Systems) respectively. The full text of the research will soon be available from the Theses section of this site.


 Joey Dumont is pursuing his graduate studies in light-matter interactions at INRS-ÉMT, while Jean-Gabriel Young has decided to remain in the fold a bit longer to continue his doctoral research.
