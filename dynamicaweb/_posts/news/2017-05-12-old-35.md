This year, Dynamica held 3 (!) end of winter semester Colloquia. 

 On April 24th, Guillaume St-Onge presented his plan for his master thesis, in a talk entitled "Dynamique de propagation sur réseaux aléatoires" (
_Propagation dynamics on Random Networks_ ); Charles Murphy did the same on May 12th. His presentation was titled "Étude de la structure croissante des réseaux géométriques" ( _The Growing Structure of Geometrical Networks_ ).


 On this occasion, Edward Laurence also passed his doctoral entry exam. An important part of the evaluation was a presentation, given on May 12th, titled
"La résilience des réseaux neuronaux" ( _Resilience of the Brain_ ).


 The three of them passed their respective tests with excellent grades, and are now free to undertake the next step; for GST and CM, this will mean writing their M.Sc thesis, while EL can officially begin the active research portion of his PhD.  
   Best of luck to them!
