After careful examination of the Master thesis of Denis Gagnon and Vincent Marceau, the examiners (3 x 2) have given the highest overall mark (excellent)
for both theses. Therefore, the names of their authors will be added to the Tableau d’Honneur of the Faculté des Etudes Supérieures et Post-doctorales
(Graduate School). Congratulations are the least we can do.
