While at the Complex Systems Summer School (Santa Fe Institute) in June 2012,
Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne and three fellow attendees studied a competitive form of percolation (competition between site and bond percolation). Doing so they demonstrated that the order parameter could undergo a macroscopic jump,
therefore answering a long-standing question as whether first-order phase transitions could occur on random networks. Congratulations are indeed in order.  
   Their paper may be found here (APS website). This fruitful collaboration also yielded another paper that appeared in PLoS Comput. Biol. at the end of last year.
