It is always a pleasure to acknowledge the continuing success of one of the members of Dynamica. Guillaume St-Onge has completed the requirements for his M.Sc. degree. His master thesis with the unmistakable title of “Dynamique de propagation sur réseaux aléatoires - Caractérisation de la transition de phase” (Propagation Dynamics on Random Networks – Characterisation of the Phase Transition) can be read here.


 Congratulations are in order, and we are happy to inform that Guillaume (STO
(or GuSTO) for the intimate few) has chosen (wisely !) to remain within the fold for his Ph. D. research with outreach towards the Lake Champlain
(University of Vermont, Burlington) under the guidance of Dr. Laurent Hébert-
Dufresne.
