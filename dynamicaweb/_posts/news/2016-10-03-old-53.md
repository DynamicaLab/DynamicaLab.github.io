Pr. L.J. Dubé will give a talk, entitled " _A Network Approach to Complex Systems---complexity made simple, ... but not simpler_ " at the Physics and Astronomy department of Western University, on Thursday, the 6th of October,
2016.


 What follows is an excerpt from the full abstract, which can be found here.



" _We will present complex systems through the looking glass of network science, a new field, perhaps only 15 years old, that gather the combined expertise of statistical physics, graph theory and nonlinear dynamics_



_[...]_



_we will focus on describing how_ [the common features of complex systems]
_emerge from simple principles in an attempt to illuminate their past and to predict their future **. Utopia or reality? The story will tell.** "_
