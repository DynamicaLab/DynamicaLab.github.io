On November 29th, 2013, Denis Gagnon met with his doctoral committee to present the work he performed in the last year. Almost a year to the day after his doctoral exam, this oral presentation allows the advisors to follow-up on the progress of the doctoral candidate. Needless to say, D.G. delivered an excellent seminar.
