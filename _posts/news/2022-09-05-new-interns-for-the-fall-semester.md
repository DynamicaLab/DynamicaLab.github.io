Dynamica warmly welcomes Benjamin Claveau, Anthony Drouin and Émile Baril who join the lab this fall as undergraduate interns. Benjamin and Émile are third-year students in Physics while Anthony is entering his second year in Engineering Physics. In collaboration with the Ph.D. candidate Vincent Thibeault, Benjamin will work on the spectral theory of the Koopman operators describing the dynamics of recurrent neural networks. Émile's project will focus on ... , an important aspect of ... 's current work. Finally, Anthony will assist the M.Sc. candidate Jérémie Gince in implementing biologically plausible learning algorithms for the Python package NeuroTorch.
