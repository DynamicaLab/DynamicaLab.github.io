After a long fought battle with a rather _persistent_ referee, the last publication of the Optics branch of Dynamica has seen the light of day. It carries the name [Dynamical rate equation model for femtosecond laser-induced breakdown in dielectrics](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.045201) or DRE for short. The first reactions are very positive and there is little doubt that the method presented  will find its way in the toolbox of the corresponding community. It serves us right to be at least as obstinate as some of the gatekeepers...
