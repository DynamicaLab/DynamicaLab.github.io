After careful examination, the evaluation committee has given the highest overall mark (excellent) to the Master thesis of Guillaume St-Onge. Therefore,
the name of the author will be added to the Board of Honour of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It perpetuates the group's tradition of excellence, with 8
theses added to the Board of Honour in 9 years.


 Congratulations are not only a good idea, but another occasion (as if we needed an excuse) for celebration.
