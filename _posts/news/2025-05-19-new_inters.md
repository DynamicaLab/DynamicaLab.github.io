We are pleased to welcome **Louis Grégoire** and **Bastien Bédard** as research interns at the Dynamica Research Lab this summer. Louis, an undergraduate student in physics, will investigate the dynamics of next-generation Hopfield networks. Bastien, who is studying mathematics, will focus on dimensionality reduction in neural networks, in collaboration with [**Nicolas Doyon**](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en/profile/nicolas-doyon) from the Department of Mathematics and the CERVO Brain Research Center. We look forward to a stimulating summer of research.
