From the 16th to the 22nd of February, the second edition of the Dynamica workshop retreats (a.k.a Rezoo) took place in Charlevoix. These events are completely organized by the students, with a sole purpose : make collaborative, bold and above all, original science in an idyllic environment.
It is also a unique opportunity for the seniors in the group to share their knowledge and their experience with the new members.


 This edition was led by Edward Laurence, along with Charles Murphy, Guillaume St-Onge, Xavier Roy-Pomerleau and Vincent Thibeault. The topic of the workshop was to adapt and develop new methods to infer the change point, and the source of the change, for dynamical processes taking place on networks. During this one week retreat, the team exploited and tested two perspectives to perform this task : Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning. Spoiler alert : it was a success, and without a doubt, it is expected that a publication will emerge from this workshop.


 Finally, the participants want to express their sincere gratitude towards the Sentinel North program and the Pr. Antoine Allard for their financial support
--without their commitment, such highly formative events could not be realized. Thank you!
