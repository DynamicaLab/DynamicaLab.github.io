The latest article from our long-standing collaboration with the [Paul De Koninck Lab](https://greenspine.ca/) has just been published in [*Science Advances*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv7576). This work, driven by the exceptional research of PhD candidate **Antoine Légaré** and supported by [Sentinelle Nord](https://sentinellenord.ulaval.ca/en), marks a key milestone in our joint efforts to bridge brain structure and function.

The paper, titled "Structural and genetic determinants of zebrafish functional brain networks," shows how brain-wide functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae uncover parallels with human brain networks. By combining whole-brain calcium imaging, structural connectivity from single-neuron reconstructions, and regional gene expression data, the study reveals that functional connectivity reflects underlying anatomical wiring, exhibits hierarchical modularity, and aligns with genetic markers—reproducing features commonly observed in mammalian brains.

A [popular science article (in French)](https://nouvelles.ulaval.ca/2025/07/11/le-cerveau-du-poisson-zebre-une-fenetre-sur-le-cerveau-humain-a:54d10a2e-9880-48a1-a799-7f7865f80f05) by **Jean Hamann** provides broader context and includes a video showcasing whole-brain neural activity in a larval zebrafish.
