The latest contribution of the Networks section is available in the February issue of Physical Review E.


 The paper entitled "Phase transition of the susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on time-varying configuration model networks" revisits the critical phenomenon of the SIS model on time-varying networks, a standard prototype for the study of epidemic outbreaks. The contribution introduces a new theoretical framework that accurately describes the phase transition for a wide range of structures and provides a comprehensive study of the impact of networks evolution through the use of a rewiring mechanism.
