The _eleventh_ edition of the Symposium Dynamica will take place on April 30th at the beautiful ForÃªt Montmorency. This pedagogical activity is held as part of the Non-linear dynamics, Chaos and Complexity course. The second half of the semester is dedicated to team projects on selected subjects ranging from KAM theorem to Markov chain analysis of musical compositions. During the Symposium, each team must present their work to a jury composed of their peers and of the members of the research group. The program of the day is available here (in french).


 We will have the honour to have Patrick Desrosiers as our distinguished guest.
