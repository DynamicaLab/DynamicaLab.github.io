Jean-Gabriel Young (OGY). He is one of 10 recipients of this year 2017 JSMF Fellowships for Studying Dynamic and Multi-Scale Systems (previously, Studying Complex Systems). The post-doctoral award comes with a small (!) stipend at the level of $200 000 US for 2 to 3 years. We congratulate OGY for this remarkable achievement and are proud to salute the collaborative spirit and work of the Network section of Dynamica that helped make the application for the Fellowship an outstanding success. After Laurent Hébert-Dufresne in 2013,
this is the second award of its kind to salute the excellence of one of the members of Dynamica. The title of the research to be pursued under the Fellowships reads:« The structure of complex, adaptive, and nonlinear systems:
Beyond pairwise interactions ». It will be interesting to watch this research unfold … For the time being, the highest possible congratulations are barely good enough.
