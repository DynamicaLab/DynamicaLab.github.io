The latest contribution of the Networks section is available in the March issue of Physical Review E.


 The paper entitled "Exact analytical solution of irreversible binary dynamics on networks" presents a set of recursive equations to solve exactly a binary cascade dynamics on networks. An algorithm built around a breath-first search procedure is introduced to accelerate the calculation, leading to an exponential time worst-case complexity instead of a factorial one.
