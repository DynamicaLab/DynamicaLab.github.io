In collaboration with the [Paul De Koninck Lab](https://greenspine.ca/) and led by Antoine Légaré, our latest research funded by Sentinelle Nord has been published in Neurophotonics. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of digital atlases for the larval zebrafish brain, integrating neuroanatomical data, gene expression patterns, and connectivity insights.
