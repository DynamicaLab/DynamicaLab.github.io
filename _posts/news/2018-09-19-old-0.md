Jean-Gabriel Young has successfully defended his thesis work on the 24th of August (see the Abstract here) and received the best of all possible evaluations for his research on “Inférence et réseaux complexes” (Inference and Complex Networks). Apart from the local team of examiners [Patrick Desrosiers (Physics), Jean-François Fortin (Physics), Nicolas Doyon
(Mathematics)], we were happy to have recruited Daniel Larremore (Computer Science, Boulder) as external referee. The final version of the thesis will be posted shorty on the theses page.
