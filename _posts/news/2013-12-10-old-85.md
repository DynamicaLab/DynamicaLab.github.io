The continued effort of our Networks division has borne fruit once again. Two new papers, _Epidemics on contact networks: a general stochastic approach_ by Dr. Pierre-André Noël is to appear in _J. Math. Bio._ while _Percolation on random networks with arbitrary k-core structure_ by Laurent Hébert-Dufresne and Antoine Allard was accepted to be published Phys. Rev. E. We heartily congratulate the authors for their work!
