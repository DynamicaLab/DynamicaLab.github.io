The recently published contribution from the Network section, "Construction of and efficient sampling from the simplicial configuration model", received some attention from the press. A popularization article entitled "The Shape of Randomness" appeared on PhysicsCentral, a web site related to the American Physical Society (APS), whose goal is to communicate the excitement and importance of physics to the large public.


 The contribution is about the "simplicial configuration model" (SCM), a null model for multinode interaction structures, Simplicial complexes. It allows easy comparisons with empirical data to determine whether the shape is surprising or random. The project was co-led by Jean-Gabriel Yound and Alice Patania, in collaboration with Giovanni Petri and Francesco Vaccarino. The publication appeared in Physical Review E this September.
