This October, Xavier Roy-Pomerleau was accepted for a talk and a poster presentation during the 8th edition of the Journée de la recherche en Sciences et Génie held at Laval University. This event was organized by the Association des étudiants gradués en sciences et génie de l'Université Laval in order to create an environment where students from all disciplines in the Faculty of Science and Engineering can exchange ideas with teachers and students from all levels.

His poster presentation was judged as the best among master’s students, which gave him the first place on the podium for this category.

Congratulations!
