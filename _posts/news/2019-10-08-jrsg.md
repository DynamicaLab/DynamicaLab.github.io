Xavier Roy-Pomerleau presented his research project (oral + poster) on October 4th during the 8th edition of the Journée de la recherche en Sciences et Génie held at Université Laval. Organized by the Association des étudiants gradués en sciences et génie de l'Université Laval (Graduate Students Association), this event brings together students from the various scientific disciplines of the Faculté des sciences et génie so they can interact and exchange ideas with teachers and students from all levels.

His poster presentation was judged the best of all presentations by master students that day.

Congratulations are in order!
