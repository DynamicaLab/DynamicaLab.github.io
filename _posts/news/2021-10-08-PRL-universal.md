The latest contribution of Dynamica has just been published in [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/), entitled [Universal Nonlinear Infection Kernel from Heterogeneous Exposure on Higher-Order Networks](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.158301).
This is the result of an international collaboration between Dynamica members ([Guillaume St-Onge](https://www.gstonge.ca/), [Antoine Allard](https://antoineallard.github.io/), and [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/)) and researchers from Queen Mary University of London ([Hanlin Sun](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/sunh.html) and [Ginestra Bianconi](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/bianconig.html)).

The article brings a new perspective on contagion dynamics: people attend various environments of different sizes, and this is through interactions with infected people that they accumulate a certain infective dose.
The authors combine this higher-order network representation with heterogeneous temporal patterns and the concept of a minimal infective dose to develop the infection.
They find that the probability of becoming infected through an environment is a nonlinear function of the number of infected people attending the environment.
Interestingly, this nonlinear function as a *universal* power-law form.
Under this nonlinear infection probability, conventional epidemic wisdom breaks down with the emergence of discontinuous transitions, superexponential spread, and hysteresis.

A press release of the paper is available on [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-mathematical-insights-epidemics.html).
