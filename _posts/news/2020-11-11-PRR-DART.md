The latest contribution of Dynamica has just been published in [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/).  

The paper entitled [Threefold way to the dimension reduction of dynamics on networks: An application to synchronization](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043215) addresses a difficult  problem: predicting the impact of network topology and dynamics on the evolution of the states of complex systems and, especially, on the emergence of collective phenomena, such as synchronization. A new method of *Dimension Reduction*, called DART, is developed to map high-dimensional dynamics unto low-dimensional ones while preserving the most salient features, both topological and dynamical, of the original system. The authors identify *three major reduction procedures* whose relative accuracy depends on whether the evolution of the states is mainly determined by the intrinsic dynamical parameters *W*, the degree sequence *K*, or the adjacency matrix *A*. DART is successfully used, for instance, to predict the synchronization curves for three phase dynamics (Winfree, Kuramoto, theta) on networks with heterogeneous and modular structures.
