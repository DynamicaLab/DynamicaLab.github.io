The 13th edition of the Symposium Dynamica took place at the [Forêt Montmorency](https://www.foretmontmorency.ca/en/) on May 2nd and 3rd.

This symposium is the final evaluation of the course _Dynamique non linéaire, chaos et complexité_ created and taught by Louis J. Dubé for many years, and now taught by Antoine Allard. The material covered is heavily based on Steven H. Strogatz [_Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering_](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering).

What makes this course a unique experience for the students is the symposium during which they present the results of the research they pursued during the semester on a topic of their choice related to nonlinear dynamics. For most of the students, the symposium consists in their first experience in doing a scientific communication with a profesional decorum.
