The three talks for the main conference were well received : time-depedent spatial network (C. Murphy), SIS dynamics with tunable dynamical correlations
(G. St-Onge), and statistical mechanics of mesoscopic structure extraction
(J.-G. Young). The main conference's poster session and the Network Neuroscience satellite were also success, featuring E. Laurence's works on persistent activity and functional resilience.


 J.-G. Young also presented his work on the Simplicial Configuration Model at the satellite workshop on higher-order models in Network Science (HONS).


 Details are available on the conference page.
