Vincent Thibeault has completed the requirements for his M.Sc. degree in physics.  His Master’s thesis entitled *Réduire la dimension des systèmes complexes: un regard sur l’émergence de la synchronisation* has been unanimously praised by the examiners [Louis J. Dubé (dir., Physics), Patrick Desrosiers (co-dir. Physics), Antoine Allard (Physics), Nicolas Doyon (Mathematics)] who have given the highest possible mark (excellent). Consequently, his name will be added to the [Board of Honor of the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies](https://www.fesp.ulaval.ca/faculte/tableau-honneur).  The final version of the thesis is available [here](/assets/pdf/theses/Thibeault20_master.pdf). Congratulations Vincent! 

Congratulations are also in order for Pr. Dubé. Indeed, Vincent is Pr. Dubé’s tenth student in twelve years to be honored by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies.  The current members of Dynamica will do their best to perpetuate this remarkable tradition of excellence.
