Charles Murphy has successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis on June 9th (see the abstract [here](/assets/pdf/affiches/2025-06-09-charles-soutenance.pdf)). His dissertation, entitled *“Reconstruction dans les systèmes complexes”*, explores how the structure and dynamics of complex systems can be jointly inferred from data, unifying the problems of network reconstruction and dynamical prediction within an information-theoretic framework.  

The examination committee was composed of Antoine Allard (director, Université Laval), Jean-François Fortin (examiner, Université Laval), Nicolas Doyon (examiner, Université Laval), Giovanni Petri (external examiner, Network Science Institute, Northeastern University London), and was chaired by Daniel Côté (Université Laval). The final version of the thesis is available [here](https://dynamicalab.github.io/assets/pdf/theses/murphy25_thesis.pdf).  

Charles has now successfully completed all Ph.D. requirements and officially received his doctoral diploma on September 1st. He accomplished this impressive journey while building a family and working part-time at [Hectiq.AI](https://hectiq.ai/), where he is now pursuing his career as a Data Scientist. **Congratulations, Charles!**
