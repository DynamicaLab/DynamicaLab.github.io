Guillaume St-Onge successfully presented and defended his PhD seminar titled *Processus stochastiques de contagion sur réseaux complexes :  au-delà des interactions par paires* on August 11th (see Abstract [here](/assets/pdf/affiches/2020-08-11-seminar-gso.pdf)).

The event resembles the PhD defense in that the candidate presents their research in a 30-minute talk, and then answers questions from an evaluation committee. The committee was composed by Antoine Allard, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, Louis J. Dubé and Patrick Desrosiers.

Congratulations Guillaume!
