The three talks for the main conference were well received : Deep learning for dynamical processes on networks (C. Murphy), prediction of synchronization regimes using dimension reduction on graphs (V. Thibeault) and prediction of localization regimes for spreading processes on networks (G. St-Onge).


 The conference was a big success, thanks to the Lead Conference Organizer Juniper Lovato and to two Dynamica alumni : Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne (Co-Chair for the main conference) and Antoine Allard (Schools Co-Chair).

Abstracts for the presentations are available on the [publication page](/publications.html).
