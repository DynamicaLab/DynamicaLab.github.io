Simon Lizotte and François Thibault will pursue their scientific jouney with Dynamica as PhD students following the successful completion of their Master's thesis (more to come on that later this fall). Following his productive summer intership in 2021, Jérémi Lesage also decided to continue working with us at the master's level.
