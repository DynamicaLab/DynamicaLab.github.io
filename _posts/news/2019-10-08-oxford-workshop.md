This September, one of our master students, Xavier Roy-Pomerleau, flew to England in order to attend to the first edition of the Workshop on Higher-order Interaction Networks: Dynamics, Structure, Data. This workshop was held at the Mathematical Institute of University of Oxford from September 9 to 11.

He was accepted for a poster presentation in which he presented how one can infer higher-order co-occurrence patterns and simplicial complexes from presence/absence data.
