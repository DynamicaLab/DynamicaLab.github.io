The Networks division will once again be participating to the NetSci conference. During the 9th edition of the international conference, Jean-
Gabriel Young will be giving a talk entitled _Structural preferential attachment of community structure and its relation to Dunbar’s number_ ,
chosen amongst 310 contributions. Our other emissary will be Laurent Hébert-
Dufresne. He shall reveal how _Complex networks are an emerging property of hierarchical preferential attachment_ in a poster presentation.


 Held in Berkeley, California this year, the meeting will provide us the opportunity to be, if only briefly, reunited with our former member, Dr.
Pierre-André Noël, who is on the program committee of this year's edition.
