The latest contribution of Dynamica has just been published in [Physical Review X](https://journals.aps.org/prx/).
The project originates from a workshop in Charlevoix in September 2016, involving
current Dynamica members (G. St-Onge, E. Laurence, C. Murphy, P. Desrosiers) and alumni, [Jean-Gabriel Young](http://www.jgyoung.ca/) and [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).

The paper entitled [Phase Transition in the Recoverability of Network History](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041056) explores the very difficult *Network Archaeology* problem : reconstructing the past states of a growing network from a single static snapshot.
Formulated as Bayesian inference task, a state-of-the-art sequential Monte Carlo method is developed to estimate the posterior distribution, used to identify and characterize a phase transition in the quality of the reconstructed history.
