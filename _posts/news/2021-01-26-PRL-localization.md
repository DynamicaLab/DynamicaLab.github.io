The latest contribution of Dynamica has just been published in [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/) alongside its companion paper in [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/), entitled [Social Confinement and Mesoscopic Localization of Epidemics on Networks](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.098301) and [Master equation analysis of mesoscopic localization in contagion dynamics on higher-order networks](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.032301) respectively.

These articles provide a theoretical characterization of **mesoscopic localization**, the localization of a dynamics in certain groups, in the context of contagions on networks.
The letter, furthermore, investigates the impact of localized epidemics on structural interventions, where groups above a certain size are removed, akin to forbidding events or gathering involving a certain number of people.
This lays the foundation for a better comprehension of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions, ultimately helping us *control* epidemics.
