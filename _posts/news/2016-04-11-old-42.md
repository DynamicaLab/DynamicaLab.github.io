As is now tradition, Dynamica will hold two Colloquia at the end of the winter semester.


 On Monday, April 11th, Edward Laurence will present his master thesis,
entitled " _Étude des systèmes complexes, des réseaux au_ _connectome du cerveau"._ He will discuss network growth and dynamics in the context of connectomics.


 On Wednesday, April 13th, Jean-Luc Déziel will pass his doctoral preparation exam. For this occasion, he prepared a presentation entitled " _Simulation d'interaction intenses entre matière et rayonnement"_. Jean-Luc will discuss the numerical processes that go into modelling interactions between light and matter, at high energy levels.


 We wish them both the best of luck!
