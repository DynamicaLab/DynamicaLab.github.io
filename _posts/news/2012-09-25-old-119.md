It is with great pride that we announce that Pierre-André Noël has successfully defended his thesis entitled "Dynamiques stochastiques sur réseaux complexes" (Stochastic Dynamics on Complex Networks), and has therefore been awarded the title of Philosophiae Doctor (Ph. D.).


 After careful study of his thesis, the four examiners have been unanimous in granting the highest overall mark–excellent in all counts. Dr. Noël's name will soon be added to the Tableau d’Honneur of the Faculté des Études Supérieures et Post-doctorales (Graduate School). The final version of his thesis will be available from the theses page in the very near future.


 Throughout his time in our group, Dr. Noël has been highly esteemed both at the personal and professional levels. Besides his talent and originality, his intellectual generosity has been one of his defining qualities. He has significantly contributed to the success of many projects, and to the training of his younger colleagues.


 Dr. Noël is now pursuing his research as a Postdoctoral Scholar in Prof.
Raissa D'Souza's group at University of California, Davis.
