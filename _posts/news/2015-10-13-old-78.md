The latest contribution of the networks section, titled " _A Shadowing Problem in the Detection of Overlapping Communities: Lifting the Resolution Limit through a Cascading Procedure_ " has just been published on the PLoS ONE website. In the paper, we show that a large class of overlapping community detection algorithm suffers from a new kind of resolution problem called shadowing. A simple meta-algorithm that circumvents the problem is proposed.
The full text is available on the publisher website (open access), and the software can be downloaded from github.
