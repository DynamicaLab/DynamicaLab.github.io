We are happy to announce the arrival of a new member, Guillaume St-Onge, to the brotherhood. While finishing his last course works for his B.Sc., and cumulating the load of a summer research student (NSERC fellowship), STO (his obvious (!) acronym) is learning the tricks of the trade in the Network Section. He has not yet passed the necessary test of our 100 kms+ bike outing,
but we are confident in his abilities. He is most welcome (until further notice) and we have set for him the investigation of Adaptive Networks started some time ago by Vincent Marceau.
