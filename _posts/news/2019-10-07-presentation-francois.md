François Thibault, who worked with Charles Murphy and Antoine Allard as an intern last summer, presented on September 17th the research he pursued during his internship. The presentation was in front of his peers and is a prerequisite for the Sigma+ certification of his B.Sc. degree. Good work François, and we are proud that you decided to continue working with us during your M.Sc. starting in May 2020.
