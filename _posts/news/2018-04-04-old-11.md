Three members of the network division will present their recent works at international conferences this summer. Edward Laurence is giving a short talk at the SIAM workshop on Network Science, held July 12-13 in Portland, Oregon,
the subject being a new dimension-reduction method for dynamics on complex networks. Vincent Thibeault and Jean-Gabriel Young will be at NetSci 2018,
held June 11-15 in Paris, France. Vincent will present his latest results on synchronization dynamics on the stochastic block model during the main conference's poster session; Jean-Gabriel will give a talk during the main conference about the now famous on twitter subject of network archeology, an analysis of our capacity to uncover the past states of a network only from its structure.


 Note that two Dynamica alumni (Pr. Antoine Allard and Pr. Laurent HÃ©bert-
Dufresne) are organizing the second edition of the satellite meeting Contagion on Networks at NetSci 2018.
