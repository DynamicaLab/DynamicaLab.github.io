The group attended the Sentinelle Nord 2019 Scientific Meeting that took place at the Lévis Convention Centre from August 26th to 28th.

Members that submitted a talk, Edward Laurence & Xavier Roy-Pomerleau, and a poster, Mohamed Bahdine, were all accepted and their presentations were well received.

Our senior member, Edward Laurence, presented a talk titled _Deciphering the time evolution of dynamical complex systems using deep learning models_. The content of this presentation was partly developed during the second edition of the Dynamica workshop retreat (a.k.a Rezoo) that was sponsored by Sentinelle Nord.

Xavier Roy-Pomerleau presented the method he developed during his master’s degree on the detection of higher-order co-occurrence patterns that can be applied to various presence/absence datasets.

Mohamed Bahdine’s poster topic was the use of deep learning to extract functional connectomes from time series.
