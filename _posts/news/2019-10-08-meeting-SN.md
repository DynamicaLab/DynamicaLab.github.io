This summer, the whole group attended the Sentinel North 2019 Scientific Meeting that took place at the Lévis Convention Centre from August 26 to 28.

Members that submitted for a talk, Edward Laurence & Xavier Roy-Pomerleau, and a poster, Mohamed Bahdine, were all accepted and their presentations well received.

Our senior member, Edward Laurence, presented on Deciphering the time evolution of dynamical complex systems using deep learning models. The content of this presentation was partly developed during the second edition of the Dynamica workshop retreats (a.k.a Rezoo) that was made possible by Sentinel North and Antoine Allard. 

Xavier Roy-Pomerleau presented the method he developed during his master’s degree on the detection of higher-order co-occurrence patterns that can be applied to various presence/absence datasets.

Mohamed Bahdine’s poster topic was the use of deep learning to extract functional connectomes from time series.
