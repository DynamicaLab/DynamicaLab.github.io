A new contribution from the collaboration between Dynamica and [Mariangeles Serrano](http://morfeo.ffn.ub.es/~mariangeles/) from the [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/) has just been published in __PLOS Computational Biology__.

The paper titled [Navigable maps of structural brain networks across species](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007584) investigates the relationship between the structure of connectomes of different species and their spatial layout both in Euclidean and hyperbolic space. Among other things, it shows that hyperbolic maps offer a quantitative meaningful representation of connectomes, and that they provide a universal framework to study decentralized communication processes in connectomes of different species and at different scales on an equal footing.
