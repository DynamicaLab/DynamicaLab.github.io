This fall, the complex network section expanded with the arrival of two new master students : Vincent Thibeault and Xavier Roy-Pomerleau. Both succeeded the traditional 100 km bicycle ride challenge, despite the injuries! They used an unexpected but surprisingly efficient Tandem strategy, a metaphor that, we hope, will inspire them through the upcoming events. Welcome aboard!
