Growth processes allow us to better understand many of the complex properties of networks, which are by nature dynamic objects.
We can go further and assume a certain growth model did generate the structure, allowing us to perform Bayesian inference on the past states of the network.
As it has been shown in a [previous study](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041056) from Dynamica, _temporal reconstruction_ is, however, a very difficult task.

The paper entitled [Inference, Model Selection, and the Combinatorics of Growing Trees](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.038301), introduces a glimpse of hope for rigorous temporal reconstruction of networks. In this project, led by [George T. Cantwell](https://www.george-cantwell.com/), current Dynamica member [Guillaume St-Onge](https://gstonge.github.io/), and alumni [Jean-Gabriel Young](http://www.jgyoung.ca/), the authors derive exact and efficient inference methods for growing trees and demonstrate them in a series of applications: network interpolation, history reconstruction, model fitting, and model selection.
