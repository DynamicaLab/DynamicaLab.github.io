Back in December, our group leader, Pr. Louis J. Dubé, received the 2015
Excellence Award in Teaching, in the "Outstanding Graduate Faculty Mentor"
category. 

 The publicity department of Université Laval just released short videos presenting the laureates (in French).


 The relevant video can be found on the official page of the awards or directly on YouTube.


 Congratulation!
