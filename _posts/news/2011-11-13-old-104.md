Following in the footsteps of Antoine Allard who received the no-less prestigious Frederick Banting and Charles Best Canada Doctoral Scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) in 2008, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne has recently been informed by NSERC of its intention to upgrade his doctoral support to the level of the Alexander Graham Bell scholarship. We bow to the wisdom of NSERC for this most judicious and well deserved decision.
