We are delighted to share that Benjamin Claveau has been awarded the distinction of the *Tableau d’honneur* of the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies at Université Laval. His M.Sc. thesis in Physics, *“Perspective spectrale sur la dynamique des systèmes complexes par la théorie de Koopman”*, received unanimous excellent evaluations from the jury, earning him this prestigious recognition.

We are especially pleased that Benjamin has decided to continue his PhD in Physics within the Dynamica Research Lab, where he will further develop research on the *Koopman operator theory of complex systems*.

Congratulations to Benjamin for this remarkable achievement and for continuing the Dynamica tradition of excellence.
