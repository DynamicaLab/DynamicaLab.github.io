A figure from our recent paper " _Complex networks as an emerging property of hierarchical preferential attachment_ " has been selected to appear in the January Kaleidoscope of Physical Review E. Figures are selected on aesthetic merit.


 Congratulations to our local artist, Edward Laurence!


 For the record, the figure was produced with D3.js, a Java library for data visualization.
