Two emissaries (Antoine Allard and Laurent Hébert-Dufresne) have been sent south of the border to take part in the 2nd International Conference on Complex Sciences: Theory and Applications, December 5–7, 2012 Santa Fe, New Mexico. Their oral presentations are titled: _On the constrained growth of complex critical systems_ and _Unveiling hidden communities through cascading detection on network structures_. The archived manuscripts may be found from the Publications page.
