Dynamica's latest contribution, led by PhD candidate Vincent Thibeault, has been published in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/nphys/). Our work critically examines the often implicit use of low-rank matrices in modeling complex systems, such as biological neural networks, revealing through linear algebra and random matrix theory that this simplification is not only widespread across various fields of reaserch but also empirically validated in over 600 real-world networks. We demonstrate that the low-rank hypothesis significantly impacts the understanding of nonlinear dynamics, enabling optimal dimension reduction and the emergence of higher-order interactions, thereby providing a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying complex phenomena.

Accompanying the publication, a [News & Views piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02268-0) within the same issue of Nature Physics discusses the implications and significance of our findings. Further extending the reach of our research, a [news article on phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-01-validating-hypothesis-complex.html) and a [blog post by Manlio De Domenico](https://manlius.substack.com/p/complexity-thoughts-issue-25) have elaborated on the paper's themes and relevance to current scientific inquiries into complex systems. In recognition of this work, Vincent has been invited to present at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University and Northeastern University's Network Science Institute (NetSI). Another notable achievement is the selection of the figure designed by Vincent and Myriam Thibeault for the front cover of the [latest issue of Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/nphys/volumes/20/issues/2).
