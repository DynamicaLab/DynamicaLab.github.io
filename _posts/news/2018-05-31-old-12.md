The latest contribution of the Photonics section is available in the May issue of Physical Review B.


 The paper entitled "Femtosecond self-reconfiguration of laser-induced plasma patterns in dielectrics" presents a self-consistent dynamic treatment of the plasma buildup and its interaction with light within a three-dimensional electromagnetic framework. This is used to study laser-induced self-
organization of transparent solids by intense femtosecond laser pulses.
