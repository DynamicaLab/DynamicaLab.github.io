From 18th to the 23rd of August, two group members had the chance to participate in Université de Sherbrooke's 2019 Summer School in Biodiversity Modelling that took place in beautiful Mount Orford, Québec. Béatrice Désy and Xavier Roy-Pomerleau, whose projects involve modelling of ecological cooccurrence and higher-order patterns, were chosen for this intense, diverse and interesting course. Béatrice and Xavier gained and brought back new insights on ecological modelling that shall complement their research, well done!
