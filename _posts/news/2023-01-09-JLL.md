Pierre-Luc Larouche has joined our team together with [Mich√®le Desjardins' lab](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/research/researchers/michele-desjardins/) as a master's student. His research project will focus on aging dynamics of neural networks in mice. Pierre-Luc had done a rewarding summer internship with us in 2021, so we are very pleased to work with him again. Welcome back Pierre-Luc!
