Béatrice Désy who joined the group in 2018 as a summer intern will be continuing her research with us as a master student co-supervised by Antoine Allard and Patrick Desrosiers.

Her research will involve both the development of null models to detect significative ecological cooccurrences and the development of a new approach to generate weighted networks embedded in hyperbolic space.
