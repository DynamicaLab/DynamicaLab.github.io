We had the great pleasure of having [Jean-Gabriel Young](http://www.jgyoung.ca) (U. Michigan) with us on October 11th. Apart from working on ongoing projects and brainstorming on future ones, Jean-Gabriel gave a lecture on the Bayesian inference of network structure from observational data.

His latest preprint on the subject can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/754077v1).
