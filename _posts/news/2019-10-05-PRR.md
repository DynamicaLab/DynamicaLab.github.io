The latest contribution to come out of the long-standing collaboration between [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) and Antoine Allard has just been published in [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/).

The paper entitled [Smeared phase transitions in percolation on real complex networks](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.013009) leverages the concept of _local order parameter_ to explore the way through which the largest connected component emerges in real complex networks. Among other things, it is shown how insights obtained from random graph models cannot always be directly used to study percolation transitions in networks with realistic complex structure.
