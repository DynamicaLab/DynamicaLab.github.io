Patrick Desrosiers and Béatrice Désy presented their work on complex networks at the latest Pinte Sentinelle Nord event at the Rideau Rouge on February 19th.  Organized by [Sentinelle Nord Student Association](https://sentinellenord.ulaval.ca/en/communaute/association-etudiante-sentinelle-nord), this biannual science outreach activity is open to the public and aims to present the research of students and professors through a series of short presentations.  These social events also contribute to building a stronger community centered around Sentinelle Nord by allowing graduate students and postdocs, who may work in different departments and have very different backgrounds, to get to know one another, and to learn about each other’s research.
