The Dynamica Research Lab is proud to announce that the Network Science Society has awarded the prestigious [Erdős–Rényi Prize](https://netscisociety.net/award-prizes/er-prize) to [Antoine Allard](https://antoineallard.github.io/) for:

> "The breadth and depth of his contributions to modeling complex systems as networks, including the geometry of networks and the role of heterogeneity and superspreading in contemporary diseases and complex contagions."

The Erdős–Rényi Prize, awarded annually to a young scientist under 40, recognizes exceptional theoretical or experimental contributions that advance the interdisciplinary field of network science. The prize, which includes a $3,000 cash award and a personalized plaque, was presented to Antoine during a special session on the final day of [NetSci2024](https://netscis2024.com/en), where he also delivered a lecture titled *Simplicity meets complexity: Reproducing complex connectivity patterns with simple models*, presenting some of his recent research.
