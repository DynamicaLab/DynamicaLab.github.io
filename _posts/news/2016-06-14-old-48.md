Guillaume St-Onges has received the Governor General's Academic Medal for his track record.


 The medal is awarded to student who achieve unusually high GPAs in the course of their B.Sc.


 This does not preclude Guillaume from running late; he supposedly showed up at the very end of the ceremony, thanks to a delayed flight back from Seoul,
where he was presenting his latest work.


 Congratulations!
