We are proud to announce that Xavier Roy-Pomerleau has successfully completed his M.Sc. degree in physics.  His impressive master’s thesis entitled "Inférence d'interactions d'ordre supérieur et de complexes simpliciaux à partir de données de présence/absence" (Inferring higher-order interactions and simplicial complexes from presence/absence data) has received very positive reviews from all the examiners: Louis J. Dubé (dir., Physics), Patrick Desrosiers (co-dir. Physics), Antoine Allard (Physics), Jérôme Comte (INRS - Eau Terre Environnement).  The final version of the thesis is available [here](/assets/pdf/theses/Roy-Pomerleau20_master.pdf).

Xavier is currently writing an article summarizing the main findings of his research.

Congratulations Xavier!
