The latest contribution from the long-standing collaboration between Dynamica and [Guillermo García-Pérez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=MibFSJIAAAAJ&hl=es), [Marián Boguñá](http://complex.ffn.ub.es/~mbogunya/) and [Mariangeles Serrano](http://morfeo.ffn.ub.es/~mariangeles/) from the [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/) has just been published in __New Journal of Physics__.

The paper entitled [Mercator: uncovering faithful hyperbolic embeddings of complex networks](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab57d2) proposes a new algorithm to embed real complex networks in hyperbolic space. The algorithm leverages several developments proposed in recent years and outperforms previous approaches in most tested cases.  Critically, the algorithm is designed to naturally unveil the community structure that may be encoded in the network structure.

A C++ code as well as a Python package are available on [Github](https://github.com/networkgeometry/mercator). Links to the full text and preprints are available on the [publication page](/publications.html).
