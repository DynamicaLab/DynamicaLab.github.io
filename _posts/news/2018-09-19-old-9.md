We had the pleasure to receive ALB, as a keynote speaker, in the realm of the second Annual Reunion of Sentinel North held in Québec city on August 27-30.
He had a fruitful exchange with members of Dynamica and both sides were left …
impressed. A nice nudge to the quality of our continuing efforts.
