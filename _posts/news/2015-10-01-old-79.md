A new member, Charles Murphy, has now officially joined Dynamica. This brings the network section to a combined force of 4 students. After he completes the Trial by Fire (an introductory marathon to nonlinear dynamics, network science and statistical physics), Morphée (his current nickname, waiting approval …)
will set on an investigation of the connectome, from a network point of view.
