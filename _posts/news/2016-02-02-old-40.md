_The most recent contribution of the photonics division, " _Constructive feedback for the growth of laser-induced periodic surface structures_ ", has been published Phys. Status Solidi C.   In the paper, we study the formation and growth of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs) with the finite-difference time-domain method.   We introduce a novel feedback mechanism which not only explains why
"classical" (type-s) LIPSSs appear on materials with dielectric and metallic optical properties, but also why type-d structures are observed on metallic materials. _
