It is with great pride that we announce that Laurent Hébert-Dufresne (LSD) has successfully defended his thesis entitled "On the Growth and Structure of Social Systems Following Preferential Attachment" and has therefore been awarded the title of Philosophiae Doctor (Ph. D.).


 There is no doubt that LSD belongs to this group of exceptional young researchers that will permeate the field of complex systems for the years to come. He has demonstrated time and time again his ability to move from ideas
(or germs of) to a workable model and his impressive list of publications bears testimony to this statement.


 The final version of his thesis will be available from the theses page in the very near future.


 Dr. Hébert-Dufresne is now pursuing his research as a James S. McDonnell Foundation Post-doctoral Fellow at the Santa-Fe Institute, New Mexico.
