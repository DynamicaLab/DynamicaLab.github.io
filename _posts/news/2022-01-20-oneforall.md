The latest contribution of Dynamica is a *News & Views* article published in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/nphys/). The authors, Patrick Desrosiers and Xavier Roy-Pomerleau, present in non-technical terms the recent findings of [Hillel Sanhedrai and colleagues](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-021-01474-y) and put their work in context, focusing on the problem of the *resilience of complex systems* and exploring previous contributions by two great theoretical ecologists, Crawford S. Holling and Robert May.
