Edward Laurence has successfully defended his thesis work on the 12th of August (see the Abstract [here](/assets/pdf/affiches/2020-08-12-edward-defense-abstract.pdf)) and received hearty accolades for his research on “La résilience des réseaux complexes” (Resilience of Complex Networks).
Apart from the local team of examiners [Louis J. Dubé (dir., Physics), Patrick Desrosiers (co-dir. Physics), Antoine Allard (Physics), Audrey Durand (Computer Science)], we were happy to have recruited a former member of Dynamica, Pierre-André Noel (Element AI – Montréal) as external referee for his expertise in Network Science and Deep Learning.

Edward is presently working in Artificial Intelligence in an AI start-up named [Hectiq AI](https://www.hectiq.ai/) based Québec City.
The final version of the thesis is available [here](/assets/pdf/theses/laurence20_thesis.pdf).

Congratulations Edward!
