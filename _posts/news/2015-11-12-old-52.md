It is with great pride that we announce that our group leader, Pr. Louis J. Dubé, has received the 2015 Excellence Award in Teaching, in the "Outstanding Graduate Faculty Mentor" category. The distinction is awarded to professors that foster an outstanding research and learning environment throughout their career. Pr. Louis J. Dubé brings the best out of every student, and, through invested mentorship, turns them in independent thinkers and researchers.
Thanks to the emphasis that he puts on communication and camaradrie, Dynamica is a tightly knit group of students akin to a family. Needless to say that the prize is well deserved, as no less than 15 members graduated from Dynamica in the past 10 years, and now pursue fulfilling academic and industrial careers.


 Congratulations on behalf of the current and past members of Dynamica.
