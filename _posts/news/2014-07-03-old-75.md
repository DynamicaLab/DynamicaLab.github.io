Last month, our Network division went to Berkeley, California to take part in the 9th International School and Conference on Network Science. Jean-Gabriel Young and Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne presented their lastest work.


 The poster entitled "Complex networks are an emerging property of hierarchical preferential attachment" was one of the five posters, out of the 150+, to be awarded the Outstanding Poster Award. You can take a look at it in Publications section.
