Charles Murphy successfully presented and defended his PhD seminar titled _Apprentissage profond de dynamiques sur réseaux complexes_ on September 30th.

The PhD seminar normally occurs during the 7th semesters into the PhD. The event resembles the PhD defense in that the candidate presents their research in a 30-minute talk, and then answers questions from an evaluation committee. The committee was composed by [Simon V. Hardy](http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~hardy) from the [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca), Louis J. Dubé and Antoine Allard.

The committee judged Charles’s performance from very good to excellent.

Congratulations Charles!
